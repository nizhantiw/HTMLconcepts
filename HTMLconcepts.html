Que. 04: What version of HTML do you use in your projects? How is HTML 5 different from HTML 4?
Answer: I used HTML 5 in my project. The main difference between HTML 4 and HTML 5 is that HTML 4 is the 4th and older version of HTML with fewer
        features and tags while HTML 5 is the extension of HTML4 and the 5th version of HTML which has new and simple features and has multiple new tags.
        HTML 4 does not support multimedia while HTML 5 supports multimedia.

Que. 07: Describe the difference between &<script>, <script async> and <script defer>.
Answer: The script with async attribute will be executed once it is downloaded. While the script with defer attribute will be executed after completing the DOM parsing.

Que. 08: Why is it generally a good idea to position CSS <link> between <head></head&> and JS <script>s just before </body>? Do you know any exceptions?
Answer: The main reason as to why JS files are linked at the bottom of the body is because whenever a browser encounters any JS, it parses it and executes that on the spot. 
Hence if it was to be added at the top, it would make the page rendering slow and thus it would take more time for page load. Moreover since the DOM won't be rendered fully, 
JS won't be able to manipulate the elements.
